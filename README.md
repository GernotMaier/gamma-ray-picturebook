# gamma-ray-picturebook

A set of plots related to gamma-ray and hadron initated air showers.

Note that this is a rather random selection of plots and prepared a long time ago (in 2005).

[gamma_picturebook.pdf](gamma_picturebook.pdf) gives an overview of typical distributions important for ground-based gamma-ray astronomy.
Additional distributions can be found in the folder [shower-distributions](shower-distributions).
